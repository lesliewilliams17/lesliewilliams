          Hi, my name is Leslie Williams. I have been a Registered Nurse for 3 years,
          but I'm ready for a change! As much as I have enjoyed it over the
          years, I know that it isn't my passion. I am ready for some more challenges,
          and have focused on learning Web Development so I can transition into this
          exciting career!

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated in 2017 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a
          Bachelor's degree in Nursing. After graduating, I headed into
          hospital work right after, for a brief period of time. I then decided to
          transition into a different kind of nursing and have been at Milan Laser Hair Removal since.
          I first held the role of a travel RN through the company for just under a year
          and a half, and then and currently hold the role as an RN at the Kansas City clinic.
